## Vehicle Body with advanced settings and lots of customisation!

#////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#
# Advanced vehicle controll system for Godot 4, created by Millu30
# This vehicle controller was made with an intention to provide more advance features such as
# transmission, lights, tyre smoke, grip controll and more features while keeping it basic and
# easy to modify according to own needs/preferences, its more simply and easy to understand
# version of Vita Vehicles that utilize the VehicleBody3D and VehicleWheel3D Node.
# I tried to provide enough informations and explain what everything does for better understanding
#================================================================================================#
# Disclaimer! This might not be the most optimal way of solving some issues but it is enough
# to build around it. If there is anything that can be optimised or changer then feel free
